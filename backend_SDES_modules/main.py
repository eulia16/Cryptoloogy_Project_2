'''
S-DES or Simplified Data Encryption Standard

The process of encrypting a plan text into an encrypted message with the use of S-DES has been divided into multi-steps which may help you to understand it as easily as possible.

Points should be remembered.
It is a block cipher.
It has 8-bits block size of plain text or cipher text.
It uses 10-bits key size for encryption.
It is a symmetric cipher.
It has Two Rounds.
Let’s start the game!
